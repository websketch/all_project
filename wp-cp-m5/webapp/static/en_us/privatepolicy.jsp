      <br>
      Like other major websites, ChinaPortal uses cookies to track traffic patterns on our website and to provide users with a customized experience when using our products and services.  A cookie is a text file that our website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our website.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.<br><br>

You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may limit system performance and may even cause certain features of the website to malfunction or not to work at all.  You agree that ChinaPortal shall not be liable to you for any such malfunction or limited system performance.<br><br>
      ChinaPortal reserves the right to set and access ChinaPortal cookies on your computer and to authorize the advertisers on the ChinaPortal site to set and access their cookies on your computer.  ChinaPortal treats any Personal Information that may be contained in cookies with the same confidentiality as other Personal Information you provide to us.  Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this policy.<br><br><span class="neiwen01">Disclosures Required by Law and Investigations</span><br><br>
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
      <br><br>
      We reserve the right to use and disclose your Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, infringement of the intellectual property of ChinaPortal or a third party, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of ChinaPortal's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.<br><br><span class="neiwen01">Security and Confidentiality of Personal Information</span><br>

      To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of Personal Information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures which we regard as appropriate to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect online.  <br>
      <br> We use encryption technology to protect the security of the information collected and transmitted on our website.  When our registration and order forms ask users to enter sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software currently available in the industry, which is known as SSL. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition, your ChinaPortal Account Information is password-protected for your protection.  After a successful login, you can change your password at your discretion.  ChinaPortal recommends that you choose a password that would be difficult to guess, that you change your password periodically and that you keep your password secret (including by not allowing friends or family members to use your account and password).  You acknowledge that you are responsible for selecting a password and maintaining its secrecy.  Under no circumstances will ChinaPortal be liable to you or any third party for your failure to maintain the secrecy of your password.<br><br><span class="neiwen01">No Liability for Acts of Third Parties</span><br><br>
Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the Personal Information you submit, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure.
