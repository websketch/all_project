<p>Customer Feedbacks</p>

<p>I've been one of the earliest subscribers of ChinaPortal. So far the experience has been great. I especially like the service quality when I watch a movie online. It is as smooth as offline. I feel like this is a new life style for me. I essentially won't need purchase any Chinese video any more as long as I'm a member of ChinaPortal.com.

<p>Your service isn't really expensive, the same as one meal or a trip to Movie theater.  For me it's really good investment.  I could watch various Chinese video programs at your website and listen to pop music.  
<br />- Frank, Atlanta, GA, USA</p>

<p>You guys really provide tons of videos.  You have very up-to-date movies such as House of Flying Daggers, 2046, New Police Story and so on; "old" movies and TV series such as "I Love My Family" and "Golden Flowers", and exclusive programs such as SMG channel and Miss World 2004.  The service is really convenient for us who don't have much access to Chinese video programs.  Good choice of Movies!

<p>Highly recommend by one friend who always rent or buy DVDs or VCDs with me, I joined ChinaPortal in Nov. The (video) quality is very good and besides lots of new movies and TV series I found lots of video I couldn't find in other places.  After joining ChinaPortal, I stopped renting or buying DVDs.  I am referring your service to all my friends now.

<p>I am registered member and I am quite satisfied with the website especially the connection speed which provides non-stopped video broadcast, unlike many of other websites boasting of high-speed or high-brandwidth. A+ service!

<p>The video quality at ChinaPortal is very high, just like DVD.  Your service enhances my life and I don't feel bored any more in weekends.

<p>I have been loyal and big fun of Feng Gong and Xianshen.   I am very excited when I could watch them on your website.  Thanks.

<p>I didn't sign up initially due to my concern that my DSL Internet connection might not be fast enough to provide good quality.  However, the movies, TV series and other programs at your website are very tempting.  I finally decided to give it try.  It turned out to be very high quality.  Since I signed up, I have been indulged myself in your service.  Thanks for such a good service.

<p>I want to install satellite TV for my parents who are visiting me.  However, the one year term and expensive monthly fee make me hesitate to do that.  As I was wondering what to do, I learned your service and registered immediately.  Now my parents enjoy your movies and TV series everyday using my fabulous 17" LCD monitor.  I even watch the videos with them when I am home.  Your service is really such a big help.

<p>I am a big movie fan and frequent visitor of DVD rental stores.  Driving to rental stores isn't inconvenient for me.  However, I am bothered by the late fee.  In order to finish all the videos in time, I didn't go anywhere after I rented DVDs, even missing last minutes parties or other important things.  That inconvenience really bothered me.  Referred by friend, I joined ChinaPortal and found that I could watch the programs anytime I want.  Therefore, I don't worry any late fee now.

<p>The programs at your website are very good: the quantity is very good, the update is very frequent. In addition, you have lots of up-to-date and exclusive programs.  Good selections!

<p>I am soccer fan and glad to find Zhongchao at your website.  It's really satisfaction for me to watch the soccer games at your websites.  Could you offer more soccer and sports programs?
<br />- Frank, Los Angels, CA, USA</p>

<p>I am an owner of a Chinese website and recommended similar service to our readers.  For unknown reasons, I couldn't get in touch with that service.  However, both our readers and I missed the similar service.  After I know your website, I contacted you immediately.  I used your service and found that it's really good, even much better that the one I used before.  Our readers also gave positive commends to your service.  I believe that your service will have great potentials.

<p>I come from Shanghai and I was loyal audience of SMG.  After I came to the United States, I miss them a lot, the familiar programs, the famous hosts¡­. It was really surprise for me to find them on your website.  Now I could watch them again and recall the life in Shanghai.   
<br />- Wendy, Seattle, WA, USA</p>

<p>As an Internet "worm", I signed up your service just for curiosity.  It's really new service and I wanted to learn more about it.  Also your $9.99 monthly fee isn't that much.  However, I liked your service immediately and finished the "Chinese Style Divorce" in three days.  It's really high quality service and good programs! 
<br />- Wayne, Boston, MA, USA</p>

<p>Surfing your website, I found lots of educational videos: swimming, aerobics, dancing, cooking, make-up, and so on.  They are really good.  Now I could improve some of my swimming and dancing skills!

<p>I used similar services before, but they all disappeared very quickly.   I don't know they had tech problem or copyrights issues.  Anyway, I couldn't find them.  However, I really miss them as I like this kind of service very much due to the convenience.  When I saw your ad, I signed up immediately.   Your service is really stable, much better than the ones I used before.  
<br />- Yun, Nashville, TN, USA</p>

<p>I have been searched for independent movies or other "vanguard" movies such as "Platform" by Jia Zhang Ke and movies of Huang Zhen Zhen.  However, it's very hard to find them here.  When I saw them at your website, I was so excited.  Please provide more of that kind of movies.

<p>To save money, I tried different free movie downloading websites. I did save money; however, I also spent too much time on the searching and downloading.  The downloading is also very slow.  Sometimes it took days to download big one.  I couldn't watch the movies immediately.  As a busy work bee, I feel it's not that convenient.   Now I feel much relaxed after I signed up your service.  It's really affordable, and I could watch the movie immediately.  Thank for your service.  I don't need to spend tons of time on surfing websites for my favorite movies.
