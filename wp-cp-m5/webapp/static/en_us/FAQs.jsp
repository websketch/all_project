        <li> <span class="biaoti01">What is ChinaPortal?</span><a name="jb01"></a><br>
          ChinaPortal (<a href="http://www.chinaportal.com" target="_blank" class="lianjie">www.chinaportal.com</a>) 
          is the leading broadband Chinese Video on Demand service legally offering 
          customers an extensive selection of Chinese and Asian movies, TV series, 
          TV programs, sports, news, children's and other video and audio programs. 
          Customers can watch their favorite programs online or offline where 
          and whenever they decide.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> <span class="biaoti01">Why ChinaPortal?<a name="jb02"></a></span><br>
          When you join ChinaPortal, you will have access to high-quality programs 
          that you can't get anywhere else. You can watch your favorite programs 
          wherever and whenever you decide. You have great selections - much more 
          than you can get from the Chinese TV channels, and you pay much less 
          than the premium TV channels. Other advantages include: 
          <ul>
            <li>No need to buy pirated copies from China</li>
            <li>No waiting for your favorite programs</li>
            <li>No more video stores </li>
            <li>No inconvenient start times</li>
            <li>No special software programs to download</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">How does it work?</span><a name="jb03"></a><br>
          It only takes 3 simple steps to watch a program at ChinaPortal: <br>
         <ol><li>Select the program from our large collection of superior programming</li>
         <li>Log into your account or sign up to be a member if you are a first time user</li>
		 <li>View programming on your PC by streaming or downloading it.</li> </ol></li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">How do I watch a program?<a name="jb04"></a></span><br>
          ChinaPortal offers two ways to watch program: streaming and downloading. 
          Both provide DVD-like quality. With streaming, you can watch the program 
          immediately while you are on the Internet. With downloading, you can 
          save the program to your PC for viewing later. For more information 
          please view &quot;<a href="#xz03" class="lianjie">What's the difference between 
          streaming and download</a>&quot;.<br><br>
          Windows Media Player 9 is required to watch the programming on ChinaPortal. 
          Windows Media Player 9 gives you the option to watch movies and programs 
          in full screen and provides functions such as fast forwarding, rewinding 
          and pausing. <br>
           <br>You can also watch the programs on your television. Please view &quot;<a href="#kk04" class="lianjie">How 
          to watch program on TV&quot; for more information</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">What are the system requirements?<a name="jb05"></a></span><br>

        <li><span class="biaoti01">How much does it cost?</span><a name="ss01"></a><br>
          Currently, ChinaPortal offers two membership packages: 
          <ul>
            <li><span class="neiwen01">ChinaPortal Basic:</span> $19.99 per month 
              for 30-hour viewing access to our entire video library 
              and free access to our radio and music library.</li>

          For more information about our membership plans, please see <a href="<%=basePath%>/static.jsp?fn=purchase" class="lianjie">purchase 
          options</a>. ChinaPortal will also be running special promotions throughout 
          the year. Please check our homepage or <a href="#" class="lianjie">sign 
          up our newsletter</a> for details. <br>

        <li><span class="biaoti01">What is the difference between ChinaPortal 
          Basic and ChinaPortal<a name="ss02"></a> Premium?</span> <br>
          The only difference between the packages is the amount of video library 
          access time you have. ChinaPortal Basic grants you 30 hours of viewing 
          per month while ChinaPortal Premium offers unlimited viewing. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">If I subscribe will I have access to all provided 
          content?<a name="ss03"></a></span> <br>
          Yes. Both ChinaPortal Basic and ChinaPortal Premium grant you access 
          to our entire video library and free access to our radio and music library. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">How do I renew my subscription?<a name="ss04"></a></span> 
          <br>
          ChinaPortal renews your subscription automatically. In the case of monthly 
          subscriptions, your subscription service will automatically renew on 
          the same date in each subsequent calendar month as the sign-up date, 
          unless you cancel the service in accordance with cancellation procedures 
          specified in <a href="<%=basePath%>/static.jsp?fn=termsofuse" class="lianjie">Terms of Use</a>.<br>
		  <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">Can I cancel my service?</span><a name="ss05"></a> 
          <br>
          Yes. To cancel, please contact customer support. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">Can I re-subscribe after I cancel my service?</span><a name="ss06"></a> 
          <br>
          Yes. If you cancel a ChinaPortal subscription you may re-subscribe at 
          any time thereafter. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">Can I get refund if I cancel my subscription 
          in the middle of my<a name="ss07"></a> pre-paid term?</span> <br>
          No. Cancellation of the service prior to the end of the pre-paid term 
          (being the pre-paid month in the case of monthly subscriptions) will 
          not take effect until the end of that term and you will not receive 
          a refund. During the balance of the pre-paid term, you will continue 
          to have access to the service. </li>

          Not necessarily. If you have downloaded a program you will only need 
          to be connected to the internet for a few minutes the first time you 
          view it. If you watch a program via streaming, you will need to be connected

          Depending on the type of connection your PC has, you can take the steps 
          listed below to view programming. Please consult your local electronics 
          retailer to learn more about the components needed for viewing. 
          <ul>
            <li><span class="biaoti01">Composite Video</span><br>
              Most DVD equipped computers have this setup. The outputs are usually 
              located at the rear or side of computer; the video output is color-coded 
              yellow and the audio output, or line-out, is the 3.5mm jack usually 
              indicated by this icon <img src="<%=themesPath%>icons/icon_image003.gif" width="22" height="16"> 
              <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li><span class="biaoti01">S-Video</span><br>
              Newer computers may have an S-video connection. In order to use 
              this feature, your TV must also have an S-Video input. <br>
              <br>
              <img src="<%=themesPath%>icons/icon_image008.png" width="87" height="60">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="<%=themesPath%>icons/icon_image010.png"><Br>
            </li>
            <li><span class="biaoti01">Audio Output but NO Video Output </span><br>
              If you have an older video card, you may not have a video output 
              that can be directly connected to your TV. In this case, you will 
              need to utilize the VGA port on your computer, which is the connector 
              that's attached to your PC monitor.<br>

        <li><span class="biaoti01">Why is the picture choppy, unclear or like 
          a slide show?</span><a name="kk05"></a> <br>
          The problem may be caused by your Internet connection. The quality of 
          the stream often depends on the amount of bandwidth that you are receiving 
          and this can vary based on many factors. The best thing to do is to 
          select a slower connection speed or to try back at a time when there 
          is less internet traffic. A dial-up connection is not recommended for 
          viewing programs. </li>

        <br>
        <li><span class="biaoti01">Why can I hear but not see the program?<a name="kk06"></a></span> 
          <br>
          This problem may be caused by either the internet connection speed or 
          the version of Windows Media Player that you are using. Please try the 
          following two methods to solve this problem:<br>
          a) ry to select a slower connection speed. This should allow the audio 
          and video to synch up.<br>
          b) Make sure that your Windows Media Player is the latest version/codec. 
          You can download the latest version by clicking here or visiting http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/download/default.asp.<br>
